# CSC606-Final-Project-Chabaud
Machine learning course project code. Developed in Google Colab
#README
All code contained for this project was created and tested in Google Colab, which runs a similar environment as Jupyter Notebook. The code was developed in different cells to deliniate what was going on in each cell. I would suggest thast anyone wanting to run this code should consider running everything in Google Colab as well for simplicity's sake. The code will be downloaded in a .py format, which can be easily imported into google colab and then each cell should be run from top to bottom. Some cells contain data that is defined in higher level cells, so it is important to ensure no errors present values not being defined before hand. Outside of running each cell from top to botto in Colab, there should be no issues with running the code. Jupyter notebook will likely also work fine so long that the cells are deliniated as well upon importing.Thank you for your time.
